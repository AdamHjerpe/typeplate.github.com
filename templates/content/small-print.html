	</header>
	<p>The <code>small</code> element is used to represent side comments or what’s commonly referred to as ‘small print’: disclaimers, caveats, legal restrictions, or copyrights. It can also be used for attributions or satisfying licensing requirements.</p>

			<blockquote cite="http://html5doctor.com/small-hr-element/">
				<p><code>small</code> is now for side comments, which are the inline equivalent of <code>aside</code>—content which is not the main focus of the page. A common example is inline legalese, such as a copyright statement in a page footer, a disclaimer, or licensing information. It can also be used for attribution. Don’t use it for block-level content (paragraphs, lists, etc.), as this would be considered main content.</p>
				<p><code>small</code> text does not need to be smaller than surrounding text &mdash; if all you want is smaller text use CSS instead. Use <code>small</code> only on inline content.</p>
