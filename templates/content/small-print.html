	</header>
	<p>The <code>small</code> element is used to represent side comments or what’s commonly referred to as ‘small print’: disclaimers, caveats, legal restrictions, or copyrights. It can also be used for attributions or satisfying licensing requirements.</p>

	<figure class="typl8-blockquote">
			<blockquote cite="http://html5doctor.com/small-hr-element/">
				<p><code>small</code> is now for side comments, which are the inline equivalent of <code>aside</code>—content which is not the main focus of the page. A common example is inline legalese, such as a copyright statement in a page footer, a disclaimer, or licensing information. It can also be used for attribution. Don’t use it for block-level content (paragraphs, lists, etc.), as this would be considered main content.</p>
				<p><code>small</code> text does not need to be smaller than surrounding text &mdash; if all you want is smaller text use CSS instead. Use <code>small</code> only on inline content.</p>

	<p><code>Monospace</code> fonts just as you desire for all your code block dreams! Monospace fonts or <i>“fixed pitch”</i> fonts, contain characters that all have the same character width. ‘l’, ‘1’ and ‘i’ are easily distinguished with monospace, ‘0’, ‘o’ and ‘O’ are easily distinguished and clear punctuation characters, especially braces, parenthesis and brackets.</p>
