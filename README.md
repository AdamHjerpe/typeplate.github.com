The problem with most frameworks is that they make decisions on how to organize, structure and design a site, but pattern libraries are similarly too tied up in markup matching their specific style and design&hellip;What we aim for is &ndash; a thing that doesn't do that.

A "typographic boilerplate", where we don't make too many design choices but we do set out patterns for proper markup and "pre-designed" styles. Something really stripped-down that's concerned with the technical and appropriate implementations of design patterns, not how they look.
