##About
The problem with most frameworks is that they make decisions on how to organize, structure and design a site, but pattern libraries are similarly too tied up in markup matching their specific style and design&hellip;What we aim for is &ndash; a thing that doesn&rquo;t do that.

web&ndash;thang is a "typographic boilerplate", where we don&rsquo;t make too many design choices, but we do set out patterns for proper markup and "pre&ndash;designed" styles. Something really stripped&ndash;down that&rsquo;s concerned with the technical and appropriate implementations of design patterns &ndash;not how they look.
