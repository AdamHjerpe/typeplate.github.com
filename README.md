##About
Frameworks make decisions for you about how to organize, structure and design a site. Pattern libraries don't separate styling and markup, making them tough to use in a truly modular fashion. We weren't satisfied, so we made a thing that doesn’t do that.
**TypePlate** is a "typographic starter kit". We don’t make aesthetic design choices, but define **proper markup with extensible styling** for common typographic patterns. A stripped-down Sass library concerned with the appropriate technical implementation of design patterns—not how they look.
